## Summary & Process
For this project, our objective was to create an app that allows the user to save and delete notes and stores their responses in a server.

I began by establishing the layout for the server.js and followed it by filling in the create.js file. However, a good amount of time was spent rearranging file structures to make sure that all pieces were accounted for. I made sure to include all functional elements as well as separating my routes into a separate file structure as well as separating the add and remove note functions from the server.js file.
